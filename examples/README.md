# Examples

This directory contains small scripts demonstrating how to use the
`gradio_pianoroll` component.

## Running the Interface demo

The `interface_demo.py` script shows a minimal `gr.Interface` where the
`PianoRoll` component is used as both input and output. Launch it with:

```bash
python interface_demo.py
```

A browser window will open with the demo running at
`http://localhost:7860`.
